# Chrome Web Store Privacy Practices Justifications - FeedBurner

## Single Purpose Description
FeedBurner is a browser extension that provides AI-powered analysis of LinkedIn posts. It adds "Summarize" buttons to posts in LinkedIn feeds, allowing users to get instant, brutally honest AI analysis that identifies self-promotion, engagement bait, humblebrags, and genuine insights. The extension uses Chrome's built-in AI (Prompt API) to analyze post content locally on the user's device.

## tabs Permission Justification
The tabs permission is required to communicate between the extension popup and content scripts running on LinkedIn pages. This permission allows the extension to:
- Query open LinkedIn tabs to send settings updates when users change AI profiles
- Send messages to content scripts running on LinkedIn pages to update AI settings in real-time
- Enable dynamic configuration of the AI analysis behavior across all open LinkedIn tabs
The extension only communicates between its own components and does not access or modify tab content directly.

## Content Scripts Host Permission Justification (https://www.linkedin.com/*)
Content scripts are automatically injected into LinkedIn pages matching https://www.linkedin.com/* to provide the core functionality. This allows the extension to:
- Detect LinkedIn post elements in the DOM and add "Summarize" buttons
- Read the content of posts that users explicitly choose to analyze by clicking buttons
- Display AI analysis results in user-friendly toast notifications on the page
- Maintain separate AI sessions for each LinkedIn tab with user-configured settings
The extension only processes content that users explicitly request and does not automatically collect, store, or transmit any LinkedIn data beyond what users choose to analyze.

## Remote Code Use Justification
Remote code execution is not used in this extension. The extension uses Chrome's built-in Prompt API for Gemini Nano, which runs entirely locally on the user's device. The Content Security Policy (CSP) in the manifest restricts script sources to 'self', meaning only local extension scripts are executed. No external JavaScript or remote code execution is performed.

## Storage Permission Justification
The storage permission is used to save user preferences and AI configuration settings locally in the browser. This includes:
- AI model settings (temperature, top K parameters)
- Custom system prompts for different analysis styles
- User-created AI profiles for different analysis preferences
All data is stored locally using Chrome's extension storage API and is never transmitted to external servers. Users can manage and delete their stored settings through the extension's settings interface.

## Data Usage Compliance Certification
I certify that this extension's data usage complies with the Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies. The extension:
- Only processes LinkedIn post content that users explicitly choose to analyze
- Does not collect, store, or transmit user data beyond local settings
- Uses Chrome's built-in AI capabilities that run entirely on-device
- Does not track user behavior or browsing history
- Provides transparency through open-source code and clear privacy disclosures
- Only requests the minimum permissions necessary for functionality
- Stores all user preferences locally and gives users control over their data

Extension data practices are clearly disclosed in the store listing and align with Google's privacy requirements.
