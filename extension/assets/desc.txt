# FeedBurner - AI-Powered LinkedIn Post Analysis

**Burn through LinkedIn's BS with brutally honest AI analysis. See the real intent behind every post - from self-promotion and engagement bait to genuine insights.**

## ✨ What FeedBurner Does

FeedBurner adds "Summarize" buttons to LinkedIn posts in your feed. Click one and get an instant AI-powered analysis that cuts through the corporate jargon and identifies:

- **Self-promotion** disguised as "thought leadership"
- **Engagement bait** like "Agree?" and "Thoughts?"
- **Humblebrags** and made-up success stories
- **Corporate buzzword** nonsense
- **Genuine insights** (when they actually exist!)

Each summary comes with unique, color-coded labels that perfectly capture the post's real intent - no generic categories, just creative, savage descriptions tailored to each post.

## 🔒 Privacy & Data Processing

- **Extension doesn't collect data** - Only reads post content you explicitly choose to analyze
- **Processed by Google's AI** - Uses Chrome's Prompt API with Gemini Nano model
- **No control over Google's processing** - We cannot guarantee what Google does with the data
- **Settings stored locally** - Your preferences stay on your device
- **Open source transparency** - Review the code to see exactly what data is processed

## 🚀 Key Features
